# ArkanoidGame
 A fun block breaker game.
 
The player attempts to bounce the ball against a number of bricks. 
The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. 
When all the bricks are gone, the player advances to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. 

This game includes *4* levels:
